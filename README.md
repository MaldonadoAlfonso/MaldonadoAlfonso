- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaldonadoAlfonso
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, demography & forecasting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R, SQL & more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects with datasets from Puerto Rico and the world, particularly topics related to population, housing and households, and perhaps infrastructure, and other fun macro variables.
- 📫 How to reach me: a.maldonado.business@gmail.com
